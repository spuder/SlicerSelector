#  üç∞ Slicer Selector

Slicer Selector becomes your default app for opening `.stl` and `.3mf` files. 
Upon opening a file, it will auto discover all your installed slicers, and prompt you which one to use.

## üíø Installation

The easiest method to install is using [homebrew](https://brew.sh)  

```bash
brew tap spuder/SlicerSelector
brew install slicer-selector
```

Once complete there will be a new app at `/Applications/SlicerSelector.app`

SlicerSelector will be the default app to open `.stl` and `.3mf` files


## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

SlicerSelector looks for popular slicers in the  `/Applications`. When a `.3mf` or `.stl` file is opened it redirects to the chosen app.

## ‚ùî Why would you want this? 

Maybe you have multiple brands of printers that need their own slicers. 
Maybe you have multiple types of printers (resin / fdm / sls) and want to easily switch between them. 

## üíª Development


1. Edit `SlicerSelector.scpt` using Script Editor application on OSX
2. Run `make all && make install` 

Currently supported slicers are: 

```
set slicerList to {"BambuStudio", "PrusaSlicer", "SuperSlicer", "OrcaSlicer", "UltiMaker Cura", "LycheeSlicer", "Slic3r", "AnkerMake Studio", "IdeaMaker", "MatterControl", "CraftWare", "Simplify3D", "ChiTuBox", "Proton Workshop", "OpenSCAD"}
```

Pull Requests welcome. 


## üêõ Known Bugs

- Prusa Slicer will not be detected if it is installed to `/Applications/Original\ Prusa\ Drivers/PrusaSlicer.app`. Workaround is to move the PrusaSlicer to `/Applications`
