## How it works

SlicerSelector looks at `/Applications` directory for installed Slicers. It presents them as a list and allows passing in options


## üíª Development

1. Modify [SlicerSelector.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/main.scpt](./SlicerSelector.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/main.scpt)


## ü•Ö Goals

- Rewrite this as a native OSX Application and include in appstore or homebrew
- Windows support
- Support multiple instances of Slicers and allow choosing which process to import into

## üêõ Known Bugs

- Prusa Slicer will not be detected if it is installed to `/Applications/Original\ Prusa\ Drivers/PrusaSlicer.app`. Move the slicer to `/Applications`

## Notes

Inspiration for this application comes from the popular browser switcher [Velja](https://sindresorhus.com/velja)
